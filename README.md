# Vue Survey

A simple survey app, built in Vue.js to demonstrate use of [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) and third-party components [vue-slider](https://github.com/NightCatSama/vue-slider-component) and [vue-chartjs](https://github.com/apertureless/vue-chartjs). With some CSS help from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/).

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

```

Built with the help of [vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
